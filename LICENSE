**A note about the licenses in the scripts and repo**

There isn't a repo-wide license of any kind, since this
repo is a collection of individual scripts, rather than
a singular application

As such, each script will have its respective license in
the code itself.

Take particular note: at present, some of the scripts
rely on xalan-j_2_7_1 as a dependency. We aren't actively
developing this, but the Apache license allows us to
store the code to make our lives just a wee bit easier.

That directory has a license for the entire thing, and
this is xalan-j_2_7_1's regardless of what other licenses
the individual scripts have.
